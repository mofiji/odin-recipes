# odin-recipes
I am building a basic recipe website.
In this project I hope to use every thing I've learnt so far in TOP and get it working.
By the end of this, I hope to be a lot better at using git and github and also become a pro at using the command line.
I also hope to able to transfer all I've learnt about HTML's to a working project :).
