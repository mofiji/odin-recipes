        <strong>Ingredients</strong>

            <li>8 ounce uncooked macaroni</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>1 12-ounce can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 cup half and half</li>
            <li>1/2-1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mozzarella cheese <em>grated</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese <em>grated</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup jack cheese</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Cooking Instructions</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375F/190C.</li>
            <li>Cook macaroni according to package directions. Drain.</li>
            <li>Add butter to a skillet, as soon as butter melts whisk in flour. Continue whisking until flour is fully mixed with butter. Then cook for about a minute to get rid of the flour taste.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the evaporated milk a little at a time, followed by the half and half; you do not want the mixture to form any lumps. Simmer for about 3-5 minutes until the mixture thickens slightly.</li>
            <li>Add your seasonings; onion and garlic powder, and cayenne pepper.</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer and let it simmer gently for about about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in all your cheeses (reserving some as toppings for later), and continue stirring until everything's melted, evenly combined, and smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta to the pot, and stir to incorporate evenly.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pasta and sauce mixture to a pan or a lightly greased 2-quart baking dish; top with the remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake at 375F/190C for 20 minutes or until golden and bubbly</li>
        </ol>
