            <li>2 teaspoons unsalted butter(optional)</li>
            <li>4 cups rinsed, uncooked long grain rice</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Cooking Instructions</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>In a blender, combine tomatoes, bell peppers, chopped onions and yellow scotch bonnet pepper with 2 cups of stock, blend till smooth (about a minute or two). You should have roughly six cups of the mixture. Pour into a large pot and bring to a boil then turn down and let simmer, covered for 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large pan, heat oil and add sliced onions. Season with a pinch of salt, stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, then add the bay leaves, curry powder and dried thyme and a pinch of black pepper for 3-4 minutes on medium heat. Then add the tomato paste- stir for another 2 minutes. Add the reduced tomato-pepper-scotch bonnet mixture, stir, and set on medium heat for 10-12 minutes till reduced by half, with the lid on. This is the stew that will define the pot.</li>
            <li>Add 4 cups of the stock to the cooked tomato sauce and bring it to boil for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the rinsed rice along with 1 teaspoon of butter, stir, cover with a double piece of foil or parchment paper and put a lid on the pan- this will seal in the steam and lock in the flavour. Turn down the heat and cook on low for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir rice- taste and adjust as required.</li>
            <li>If you like, add more sliced onions, fresh tomatoes another teaspoon of butter and stir through.</li>
        </ol>
